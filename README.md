How to run: 
```
make venv
make setup
```
Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to activate the virtual environment with the Makefile, so you have to do it manually.
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
To run the program:
```
make run
```  
You can check an example output file from the program with the `Registo_Treino Diogo.docx` file. 

### TODO
